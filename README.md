| 20  | [A company operates its IT services through a multi-site hybrid infrastructure. The company deploys resources on AWS in the us-east-1 Region and in the eu-west-2 Region. The company also deploys resources in its own data centers that are located in the United States (US) and in the United Kingdom (UK). In both AWS Regions, the company uses a transit gateway to connect 15 VPCs to each other. The company has created a transit gateway peering connection between the two transit gateways. The VPC CIDR blocks do not overlap with each other or with IP addresses used within the data centers. The VPC CIDR prefixes can also be aggregated either on a Regional level or for the company's entire AWS environment. The data centers are connected to each other by a private WAN connection. IP routing information is exchanged dynamically through Interior BGP (iBGP) sessions. The data centers maintain connectivity to AWS through one AWS Direct Connect connection in the US and one Direct Connect connection in the UK. Each Direct Connect connection is terminated on a Direct Connect gateway and is associated with a local transit gateway through a transit VIF. Traffic follows the shortest geographical path from source to destination. For example, packets from the UK data center that are targeted to resources in eu-west-2 travel across the local Direct Connect connection. In cases of cross-Region data transfers, such as from the UK data center to VPCs in us-east-1, the private WAN connection must be used to minimize costs on AWS. A network engineer has configured each transit gateway association on the Direct Connect gateway to advertise VPC-specific CIDR IP prefixes only from the local Region. The routes toward the other Region must be learned through BGP from the routers in the other data center in the original, non-aggregated form. The company recently experienced a problem with cross-Region data transfers because of issues with its private WAN connection.

### A company operates its IT services through a multi-site hybrid infrastructure. The company deploys resources on AWS in the us-east-1 Region and in the eu-west-2 Region. The company also deploys resources in its own data centers that are located in the United States (US) and in the United Kingdom (UK). In both AWS Regions, the company uses a transit gateway to connect 15 VPCs to each other. The company has created a transit gateway peering connection between the two transit gateways. The VPC CIDR blocks do not overlap with each other or with IP addresses used within the data centers. The VPC CIDR prefixes can also be aggregated either on a Regional level or for the company's entire AWS environment. The data centers are connected to each other by a private WAN connection. IP routing information is exchanged dynamically through Interior BGP (iBGP) sessions. The data centers maintain connectivity to AWS through one AWS Direct Connect connection in the US and one Direct Connect connection in the UK. Each Direct Connect connection is terminated on a Direct Connect gateway and is associated with a local transit gateway through a transit VIF. Traffic follows the shortest geographical path from source to destination. For example, packets from the UK data center that are targeted to resources in eu-west-2 travel across the local Direct Connect connection. In cases of cross-Region data transfers, such as from the UK data center to VPCs in us-east-1, the private WAN connection must be used to minimize costs on AWS. A network engineer has configured each transit gateway association on the Direct Connect gateway to advertise VPC-specific CIDR IP prefixes only from the local Region. The routes toward the other Region must be learned through BGP from the routers in the other data center in the original, non-aggregated form. The company recently experienced a problem with cross-Region data transfers because of issues with its private WAN connection. The network engineer needs to modify the routing setup to prevent similar interruptions in the future. The solution cannot modify the original traffic routing goal when the network is operating normally. Which modifications will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- [ ] Remove all the VPC CIDR prefixes from the list of subnets advertised through the local Direct Connect connection. Add the company's entire AWS environment aggregate route to the list of subnets advertised through the local Direct Connect connection.
- [ ] Add the CIDR prefixes from the other Region VPCs and the local VPC CIDR blocks to the list of subnets advertised through the local Direct Connect connection. Configure data center routers to make routing decisions based on the BGP communities received.
- [x] Add the aggregate IP prefix for the other Region and the local VPC CIDR blocks to the list of subnets advertised through the local Direct Connect connection.
- [ ] Add the aggregate IP prefix for the company's entire AWS environment and the local VPC CIDR blocks to the list of subnets advertised through the local Direct Connect connection.
- [x] Remove all the VPC CIDR prefixes from the list of subnets advertised through the local Direct Connect connection. Add both Regional aggregate IP prefixes to the list of subnets advertised through the Direct Connect connection on both sides of the network. Configure data center routers to make routing decisions based on the BGP communities received.

The company is using an open-source recursive DNS resolver in a VPC subnet and is using a DNS resolver in the on-premises data center. The company's on-premises DNS resolver has a forwarder that directs requests for the aws.example.com domain name to the DNS resolver in the VPC. The DNS resolver in the VPC has a forwarder that directs requests for the corp.example.com domain name to the DNS resolver in the on-premises data center. The company has deckled to replace the open-source recursive DNS resolver with Amazon Route 53 Resolver endpoints. Which combination of steps should a network engineer take to make this replacement? (Choose three.)

### A company collects a high volume of shipping data and stores the data in an on-premises data center. A network engineer wants to use Amazon S3 to store the data during the first phase of a migration to AWS. During this phase, an application that resides in the data center will need to access the data privately in an S3 bucket that the company created. The company has set up an AWS Direct Connect connection with a private VIF to connect theon-premises data center to a VPC. The network engineer plans to use this Direct Connect connection forthe hybrid cloud setup. The solution must be highly available. What should the network engineer do next to implement this architecture?

- [ ] Configure an S3 gateway endpoint in the VPC. Update VPC route tables to route traffic to the S3 gateway endpoint. Configure the S3 gateway endpoint DNS name in the on-premises application.
- [x] Configure an S3 interface endpoint in the VPC. Configure the S3 interface endpoint DNS name in the on-premises application.

### A company is designing infrastructure on AWS with three VPCs connected to a transit gateway. Thethree VPCs are an application VPC, a backend VPC, and an inspection VPC. The application VPC and the backend VPC have compute instances deployed in Availability Zone A and Availability Zone B. Stateful firewalls are deployed in the same Availability Zones in the inspection VPC, which is a shared servicesVPC. All traffic is routed through the inspection VPC through the stateful layer 7 virtual firewall appliances to comply with a security policy that mandates traffic inspection. There are no overlapping IP addresses across the three VPCs. A network engineer must ensure that traffic between the application VPC and the backend VPC can route through the inspection VPC's stateful firewalls. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- [ ] Create IPsec VPN connections between the transit gateway and the virtual firewall appliances.
- [ ] Configure Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) on the virtual firewall appliances.
- [ ] Set up BGP between the transit gateway and the virtual firewall appliances.
- [x] Enable transit gateway appliance mode for the VPC attachment to the inspection VPC.

### A company is migrating many applications from two on-premises data centers to AWS. The company's network team is setting up connectivity to the AWS environment. The migration will involve spreading the applications across two AWS Regions: us-east-1 and us-west-2. The company has set up AWS Direct Connect connections at two different locations. Direct Connect connection 1 is to the first data center and is at a location in us-east-1. Direct Connect connection 2 is to the second data center and is at a location in us-west-2. The company has connected both Direct Connect connections to a single Direct Connect gateway by using transit VIFs.
